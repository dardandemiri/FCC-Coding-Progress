        <h4>Why is he special:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>He does what needs to be done, not what is easy, nor what is normal.</li>
            <li>He doesn’t just think about himself, he cares for the causes which affects the nature and the future of human beings.</li>
            <li>He doesn’t just dream big, he works really hard to achieve it.</li>
            <li>He doesn’t give up when he fails, he tries to find out what went wrong, he learns from his mistakes and comes back stronger.</li>
          </ol>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Always be learning</strong>	-The amazing fact about Elon is that he is self-taught inprogramming, Physics and rocket science! As a kid, he used to read encyclopedias by the dozen. Apparently he turned into a bookworm since he was bullied at school and read, voraciously, to gain knowledge and understand concepts. Obviously, these books played a major role in his decision to create companies that will have a positive effect on the world.</li></br>
          
          <li><strong>Insane work ethic</strong>-Elon Musk is a hardcore workaholic, working 100 hour weeks, and has been doing so for many years.</li></br>
          
          <li><strong>Focus on the big picture</strong>-Elon has taken on extremely challenging problems that have been the bane of mankind for many decades. He has identified three main areas where he wants to make a difference (internet, clean energy & space), taking big risks in each field with no short term gains in sight. In the next 10 years, he wants to put a man on Mars and is committed to retiring on Mars with 80,000 other colonists!</li></br>
          <li><strong>Sacrifices galore</strong>-With everything that he does, Elon really has his skin in the game. He has invested his savings in ventures that he believes in, at the risk of going broke. Elon is not afraid to make hard decisions and does not compromise on his vision.</li></br>
          <li><strong>The feedback loop</strong>-Elon is constantly soliciting feedback and doing self-analysis. He is constantly thinking of what he has done and how it could be done better.</li></br>
          
          <li><strong>Hands On</strong>-Elon is a brilliant applied engineer and has the ability to think at the system level of design. He gets his hands dirty by working with the engineers on the ground.He personally test-drives the changes to the Tesla car before it goes out to customers. He loves getting into the details. The man is less of a talker and more of a doer. His “lean startup” kind of approach makes him a “sleeves folded” kind of leader that people want to work with.</li></br>
          
          <li><strong>A crack team with clarity of thought</strong>-The man knows exactly what he wants and leads a team that is super intense. He hires the best minds on the planet, pays them stock and has no tolerance for bullshit. He is a bridge between the market requirements and what the engineers on the ground aspire to do. He seems to be a taskmaster of sorts but his attitude sets the culture of the team. His goal setting skills are legendary and he puts his heart and soul into achieving those goals!</li>
          </br>
          <li><strong>Ambition</strong>-Even after 3 launch failures of the SpaceX rocket, he had the tenacity to continue and persist through the odds. He is driven to do the “right thing” and does not bother about the status quo. His determination to overcome competitor lobbyists is amazing. The man is intrinsically motivated and pushes himself real hard. His never give up attitude gives him the ability to “stick with it.”[1]Musk proposed using SpaceX’s forthcoming mega-rocket (codenamed “Big Fucking Rocket” or BFR for short) to lift a massive spaceship into orbit around the Earth. The ship would then settle down on floating landing pads near major cities. Both the new rocket and spaceship are currently theoretical, though Musk did say that he hopes to begin construction on the rocket in the next six to nine months.</li>
